            <h4>Day 1 : </h4>
		      	<p>
					After a scenic drive from Christchurch, we arrived at the White Horse Hill campsite, located at the base of Mount Cook. We set up our tents and enjoyed
                     a relaxing picnic lunch while taking in the stunning views of the mountains and glaciers. In the afternoon, we went on a short hike to the nearby Hooker Valley Track, which offered breathtaking views of the Hooker Glacier and the surrounding mountains.
                      As the sun started to set, we returned to our campsite and made a delicious dinner over a campfire.
